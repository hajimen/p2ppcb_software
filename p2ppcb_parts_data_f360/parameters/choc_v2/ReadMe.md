# Hack for Choc V1 Stabilizer

Use this `height.csv`:

```
Specifier,Travel,SwitchStemBottomHeight,SwitchBottomHeight
1.*u,3.2 mm,2.9 mm,-2.2 mm
.*,3.2 mm,3.6 mm,-2.2 mm
```

It makes stem insertion shallow, and makes a room for Choc V1 stabilizer.
But you cannot use a spacebar anyway. There is no spacebar for MX stem and 76mm wire.
